# What is this repository

This is just an "aggregate" repository, just a bunch of CODE that I use/write.

# What is the license?

Each subpackage should have a LICENSE file listing the license for the code under that folder.

When that file is missing, the LICENSE on the top folder is the valid license for that code.

# Contributions

When some package here grows that more people want to use it, then that package should have a,
repository of his own, in that case the contributions will be sent to that new repository.

So, no pull requests will be accepted in this repository, but any issues reported will be considered,
and like I said, if something here grows too much then it don't belong to this repository anymore.

# Why?

Because having one repo with lots of random code is much easier to handle than having lots 
of random repos.
